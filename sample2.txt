once there lived a rabbit and tortoise. 
one day they thought of having a competition to reach a particular goal.
Then they started to run. 
After sometime rabbit went very close to reach the goal then it started thinking that tortoise will come very slow so i can rest for sometime and then reach the goal first. Å›
